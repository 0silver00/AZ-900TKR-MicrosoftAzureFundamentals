In this walkthrough, we will access and identify Azure preview services and features, and view the latest Azure updates information.

Estimated time: 10 minutes

**Task 1: Access preview services and features**

In this task, we will review Marketplace Preview features. 

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com).

2. Search for and select **Marketplace**. 

3. Search the Marketplace for **Preview**. Review any preview products that interest you. 

4. Search the Marketplace for **Kubernetes Service**. Select the Kubernetes Service, and click **Create**.

5. In the **Kubernetes Version** drop-down notice there is a **Preview** version. Not all services will have a version in preview.

    **Note**: In these scenarios, where new functionality or features are made available within an existing generally available Azure service or product, although you may be using the Azure service in production, the preview feature or functionality may not yet be ready for production deployments. And you should make sure you are aware of any limitations around its use before deploying to production.

**Task 2: Review the Azure Updates page**

In this task, we will review the Azure Updates page.

1. In a browser go to the [Azure Updates](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/updates/) page. 

2. Note the presence of four tab options i.e. **All**, **Now Available**, **In preview** and **In development**

3. Click on the **In preview** tab and type **Kubernetes** in the search for a search box, then select Azure Kubernetes Service (AKS) when prompted. The page returns a list of items in preview related to Kubernetes. Your result list may be different.

3. Click on any item in the results list to get more detailed information. 

4. Return to the **Azure Updates** page, view items that are now have a status of **General Availability** by clicking **Now available** and noting the items now displaying. Browse any that are of interest to you.

5. Return to the **Azure Updates** page, click on the **In development** tab and note the items returned that are currently in development. Browse any that are of interest to you.


Congratulations! You have accessed and identified Azure preview services and features, and viewed the latest Azure updates information.
